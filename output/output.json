 "review": "I have had and used (borderline abused!) my canon camera bag for about 10 years and can't recommend it enough. It is has taken a beating but still looks great and has held up really well. The bag is sturdy and protective. It has perfect amount of space for my Canon 60D, with enough room to cary an additional small micro-lens. (When I had a smaller DLSR, the bag perfectly held the camera body and 2 larger lenses). I recently repurchased this camera bag for my father.",
